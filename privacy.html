    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Aibek Mazhitov&#39;s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any
        applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our app,
        Vibely - Music Visualizer, and its associated services. </p>
    <p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about
        you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information
        about how you use an app or online service. </p>
    <p>In the event our app contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services
        have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted
        privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply
        to any of your activities after you leave our app. </p>
    <p>This policy is effective as of 21 December 2021. </p>
    <p>Last updated: 21 December 2021 </p>
    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: "voluntarily provided" information and "automatically
        collected" information. </p>
    <p>"Voluntarily provided" information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when
        using our app and its associated services. </p>
    <p>"Automatically collected" information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the
        course of accessing our app and its associated services. </p>
    <h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
    <p>We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following on our website: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a mobile device or web browser to access our content</li>
        <li>Contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies</li>
        <li>When you mention us on social media</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with general information or
        research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example, If you consent to us accessing your social media
        profiles, we may combine information sourced from those profiles with information received from you directly to
        provide you with an enhanced experience of our app and services. </p>
    <h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
    <p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within
        commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use,
        or modification. </p>
    <p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of
        electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. </p>
    <p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own
        information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring you do not make your personal information
        publicly available via our platform. </p>
    <h4>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
    <p>We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using
        your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal
        information such as an email address when contacting us about a specific enquiry, we may retain this information for
        the duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for our own records so we may effectively address similar
        enquiries in future. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make
        it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. </p>
    <p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or
        reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes
        or statistical purposes. </p>
